In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse to combine. Add shortening and butter. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 4 tablespoons of water and pulse to combine. Add more water as needed, until the dough comes together when pressed. It should not be overly moist. Dump the dough onto plastic, wrap it up, forming it into a disc. Refrigerate it for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.After the dough has chilled, divide it into 2 equal pieces.  On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the crust so it is large enough to fir your pie pan.  Press it into the pan.  Roll the other half so it is large enough to cover the pie after being filled.  Fold that half gently into quarters and place inside the pie pan.  Put the pan with both crusts back in the refrigerator while you make the filling.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Make the filling.  In a large bowl, combine rhubarb, sugar, cornstarch, and orange juice and zest.  Stir until all of the ingredients are well combined.Spoon the rhubarb into the pie shell.  Try not to get too much of the juice.  Scatter the butter over the top and spoon one spoonful of juice over the top if there is a lot left.  DO NOT add all of the juice or your pie will be soupy.  Place the top half of the crust over the fruit and press the top and bottom crust together firmly, creating a seal.  Flute the edges if you would like.  Brush with milk and sprinkle with demerara sugar.  Bake for 15 minutes on a foil lined baking sheet to catch any bubbling juices.  Without opening the oven, reduce the temperature to 375 and continue baking for about 1 hour more, rotating halfway through if necessary, until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling vigorously.  Cool completely in pan.  Pie may be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days or frozen in pieces, wrapped in parchment and foil and placed in a zipper bag.  Thaw in a 350 degree F oven for about 30 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the crust. In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, and salt.

Prepare 15 standard cupcake liners on a lined baking sheet and set aside.                    Melt the chocolate in a microwave and stir until smooth.  Set aside to let cool slightly.                    Place the butter, sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment.                    Beat on low to medium speed until light and fluffy.                      Add the eggs and beat on low speed until incorporated.                    Sift together the plain flour and baking powder.  Add half of the flour mixture to the egg and butter mixture and mix until smooth.                      Add the milk to the batter, while mixing, and finally the remaining flour mixture.  Mix until smooth.                    Finally, fold through the melted chocolate, making sure the batter is well mixed and no streaks remain.                    Divide the mixture between the cupcake liners.  Bake at 175 for 20 minutes or until risen and cooked through.  Make sure not to over bake the cupcakes.                    Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely on a wire rack.                    Half fill a large piping bag with the Salted Vanilla Caramel Buttercream.  Use whatever decorative or plain tip you prefer.  Pipe swirls of buttercream on each cupcake.                    Finish with a drizzle of extra Salted Vanilla Caramel Sauce.                    Once frosted, the cupcakes will keep fresh for a several days, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.                    Place the egg whites and cream of tartar into the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk until frothy. Add the first amount of caster sugar in a steady stream while still whisking. Continue to whisk at medium speed while you prepare the sugar syrup.                    Place the water into a stainless steel or copper saucepan. Add the second amount of caster sugar in the centre. Place over a low to medium heat to dissolve the sugar. Do not stir the syrup as it cooks. Raise the heat and cook the syrup until it reaches 130.                    By this stage, the egg whites should have reached a soft peak stage. As you continue to whisk, add the hot syrup in a steady stream, down the sides of the meringue. Avoid pouring directly down the side of the bowl or on to the whisk. Keep whisking until the meringue reaches stiff peaks and is cooled completely.                    Make sure the butter is at room temperature and soft and pliable, or else the buttercream will be lumpy. By the same token, make sure your meringue has cooled so that it won't melt the butter, making the buttercream runny.                    Replace the whisk attachment with the paddle attachment.                    Add the butter one-third at a time, beating well after each addition until the cubes of butter have been fully incorporated into the meringue. The mixture will appear to separate a little but just keep whisking and it will become smooth and light and fluffy.                    Add the Salted Vanilla Caramel Sauce and beat until incorporated.                    The buttercream is now ready to pipe.                    If making ahead of time, store covered and airtight in the refrigerator for several days.                    This buttercream can also be frozen for up to a month before defrosting, beating and using.                    Place the sugar into a stainless steel saucepan.  I prefer stainless steel as this allows me to see the colour of the caramel as it cooks.                    In a separate saucepan, place the cream and heat gently until it reaches boiling point.  Switch off the heat.                     Place the pan over a low heat and gently stir the sugar as it dissolves.  The best action is to gently move the sugar toward the middle of the pan and back, checking the edges of the pan for any sugar that is dissolving and colouring too quickly and mix it in.    Dont take your eyes off it for a second and have patience.  When it is all dissolved, stop stirring and let it cook until the colour deepens.  You can gently swirl the caramel on the base of the pan to make sure the caramel darkens evenly.  Cook the sugar until the caramel is a lovely deep amber colour.                    When ready, carefully pour in the warmed cream, stirring as you go.  Keep stirring over a low heat until the mixture is smooth.  Remove from the heat, add the vanilla and salt (to taste), and stir in the butter in two batches.  Stir until the caramel is smooth and silky.  Pour the caramel into a bowl or jar, and set it aside to cool before using.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 17","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Prepare 15 standard cupcake liners on a lined baking sheet and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404676,"name":"muffin liners","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/muffin-or-cupcake-forms.png"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Melt the chocolate in a microwave and stir until smooth.

Heat a large frying pan over medium high heat. Add the sesame oil and ginger and fry until fragrant. Add the ground pork and stir-fry, using the edge of a spatula to break up the meat into little crumbs. When the meat is cooked, add the onion, carrot, celery, and shiitake mushrooms and continue stir-frying until the carrots are mostly cooked. Add the napa cabbage and glass noodles and continue stir-frying until the cabbage is mostly cooked. Add the sauce and stir-fry until there is no liquid left. Let this mixture cool. Make some glue by combing 3 tablespoons flour with 3 tablespoons water. Peel the wrappers and spread them out as pictured with about 1/2\" of the wrapper below showing. This makes it easy to paint glue on several wrappers at once. Spread the glue with a pastry bush along the top edges of the wrapper. Place about 1/3 cup of the room temperature filling about 2 inches above the bottom corner of the wrapper. Tightly roll the wrapper and filling half-way.Fold the left edge over right up against the edge of the filling, then fold the right edge over. The trick here is to taper your fold slightly so that the open flap is a little narrower than the bottom of the roll as this will create a good seal and prevent flaps of dough that will invite oil into your roll. It should look a bit like an open envelope at this point. Finish by continuing to roll until the flap seals itself against the roll. To make the sweet and sour sauce, whisk together the water, vinegar, sugar, ketchup, potato starch and salt in a small saucepan until there are no lumps. Bring the mixture to a boil stirring constantly until your sauce has thickened. Prepare a paper towel lined rack. Pour about 2\" of vegetable oil into a heavy bottomed pot and heat to 320 degrees F. Fry the springrolls a few at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Turn them over frequently so that they brown evenly. When they reach an even tan color, transfer the spring rolls to your rack and allow them to drain. Repeat with the rest of the spring rolls.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the oyster sauce, Shaoxing, potato starch, soy sauce, white pepper and salt in a small bowl and whisk together.","ingredients":[{"id":11413,"name":"potato starch","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg"},{"id":6176,"name":"oyster sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/oyster-sauce.jpg"},{"id":16124,"name":"soy sauce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/soy-sauce.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat a large frying pan over medium high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the sesame oil and ginger and fry until fragrant.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the ground pork and stir-fry, using the edge of a spatula to break up the meat into little crumbs.
